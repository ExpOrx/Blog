289175cd58f7deff840bb09f6d42766e102a10d664846825e9fddd3f8dbc915a,B2,CC,"Actor StartUPTEAM (aka maximumpota, adsadas, dima3228, ¥ßÖ¥ñ¥¥, Yello) sells account checking tools targeting 24 businesses; Focus on banks, airlines, hospitality companies","<p><strong>Assessment of claim</strong></p>

<p>Our source&nbsp;engaged actor <strong>StartUPTEAM </strong>and obtained his full tool list, which comprises 24 account-checking tools targeted at the following services:<br />
&mdash; YTmonster.net<br />
&mdash; Zenmate.com.ru<br />
&mdash; WindScrible.com<br />
&mdash; BITdig.net<br />
&mdash; 1xBet.com<br />
&mdash; Olx.ua<br />
&mdash; Ihg.com<br />
&mdash; Expedia.com<br />
&mdash; Adfoc.us<br />
&mdash; Bitcoinrush.io<br />
&mdash; Coinroyale.com<br />
&mdash; Giftcardmall.com<br />
&mdash; RBC Bank<br />
&mdash; Britishairways.com<br />
&mdash; Americanexpress.com<br />
&mdash; Discover.com (Bank+CC)<br />
&mdash; Orbitz.com<br />
&mdash; Booking.com<br />
&mdash; eMoney.ge &ndash; fresh and awesome!<br />
&mdash; cashback.epn.bz<br />
&mdash; eBay.com<br />
&mdash; Amtrak.co.uk<br />
&mdash; Samsclub.com<br />
&mdash; Lufthansa.com</p>

<p>Price tags range from US $15 to US $60 per tool, depending on specific targeted service and tool functionality. For instance, American Express and British Airways account checkers cost US $15 per piece, a tool targeted at Discover, which allegedly consists of two checkers, costs US $40; while the Lufthansa account-checking tool is being sold for US $20.</p>

<p>We also assume that along with selling account checking tools, the actor might be targeting some online services himself, because&nbsp;at cybercrime forums he was selling databases of compromised email credentials that are typically used with account-checking tools.</p>

<p>While chatting with our source, the actor&nbsp;<strong>StartUPTEAM</strong>&nbsp;also has&nbsp;claimed that in addition to developing and selling brute-forcing and&nbsp;account-checking tools, he has a side occupation &mdash; reselling a piece of malware dubbed Reborn Stealer. According to the actor, the malware originally&nbsp;was developed by his partner, the actor ((<strong>TheBottle</strong>)), who specializes in malware coding and is primarily active on the Exploit forum.</p>

<p>In our earlier reports, we already covered actor <strong>TheBottle </strong>(aka ((<strong>Or1ginshik</strong>)), ((<strong>Originshik</strong>)) ) as a vendor of a mining bot dubbed &quot;Cerberus&quot; (see the Similar Reports section). Our research indicates that currently Reborn Stealer is being sold across at least four forums &mdash; Fuckav, Bhf, Blackbiz, and Rat-club &mdash; by different handles, who are likely all alternatives personas of <strong>StartUPTEAM</strong>.</p>

<p><br />
Our source&nbsp;also obtained the actor&#39;s&nbsp;account checking-tool targeted at American Express, which is attached. This allows us to assess actor&rsquo;s claim as &ldquo;2 &mdash;&nbsp;Probably True.&rdquo;</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Activity by StartUPTEAM on Bhf</strong></p>

<p>The actor joined the community July 16, 2017, but he seems to be steadily increasing his reputation and by the day of the reporting, collected six&nbsp;&ldquo;likes&rdquo; and earned 91 contribution points.

<p><br />
<strong>Other activity of StartUPTEAM</strong></p>

<p>Searching the above mentioned Jabber IDs shizoshop@sj.ms and basebase2018@jabber.cz through our database revealed the actor&rsquo;s presence on WWH-club and Fuckav forums:</p>

<p>On WWH-club the actor has been running multiple profiles:</p>

<p>1. The handle ((<strong>maximumpota</strong>)) &ndash; joined July 15, 2017, and&nbsp;has a negative &ldquo;-3&rdquo; level of reputation. The actor&#39;s activity sums up to 15 posts, which are identical to those&nbsp;posted on Bhf.</p>

<p>2. The handle ((<strong>adsadas</strong>)) joined July 27, 2017, and used this profile to&nbsp;sell&nbsp;compromised databases.</p>

<p>The actor joined Fuckav forum June 5, 2017, under the handle ((<strong>dima3228</strong>)) and using the Jabber ID ((dima2991@fuckav.in)). The actor&rsquo;s profile was subsequently banned for &ldquo;suspicious activity,&rdquo;&nbsp;which usually indicates possible account takeover or similar issues. During his tenure on the board, the actor started two threads &mdash;&nbsp;one to sell&nbsp;the Reborn Stealer malware and&nbsp;another to&nbsp;advertise&nbsp;a malware crypting service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
