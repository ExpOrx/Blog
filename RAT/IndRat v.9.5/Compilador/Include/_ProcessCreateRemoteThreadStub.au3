;
;  Functions used to create a small Remote Thread Stub to start and Exit (quickly, hopefully) a Remote Thread
;	that was created using the 'undocumented' mode in _ProcessCreateRemoteThread(), and optionally inject it.
;	It is suggested that the better route would be to code this into the binary code itself, however
;	this can be used for simple execution of things like DLL Inject/UnInject and regular 0-to-1 parameter API calls -
;	 *as long as any pointers passed are pointers WITHIN the process*. (**int64 returns wont work in x86)
;	NOTE: MUST DESTROY AN INJECTED STUB *AFTER* THREAD TERMINATION AND *BEFORE* PROGRAM EXIT
;
; Functions:
;	_ProcessGenerateThreadStub()	; Creates the binary code for a Thread Stub, but doesn't inject it
;	_ProcessCreateRemoteThreadStub(); Creates a remote Thread Stub, injects it, and returns a pointer to it
;									; NOTE that this *MUST* be destroyed AFTER the Thread has terminated, and
;									; *BEFORE* program Exit.  It will not free itself on its own.
;	_ProcessDestroyRemoteThreadStub()	; Destroys the Remote Stub created by _ProcessCreateRemoteThreadStub()
;										; As above, note that this MUST be done AFTER Thread termination

; Func _ProcessGenerateThreadStub($hProcess,$iProcessID,$pCodePtr,$bWow64Code=False)
;
; Function to create the Binary data for a Thread Stub to be injected into a Remote Process.
;	This code can be injected alongside other code/data, as long as it is:
;	1. allocated with PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE protection, and
;	2. the code is aligned on a 16-byte address [since VirtualAllocEx returns page-aligned ptrs, set this at the start]
;	Optionally the code can be allocated and injected on its own: _ProcessCreateRemoteThreadStub() will do this,
;	 though the separate allocation will take up more memory due to allocation granularity
;	 [one small allocation can use 64KB of memory!])
;
; $hProcess = handle to opened process
;	NOTE: Process must have been Opened with these attributes (0x043A total):
;	   PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD, PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION, PROCESS_VM_OPERATION, PROCESS_VM_WRITE, and PROCESS_VM_READ
; $iProcessID = Process ID #
; $pCodePtr = pointer to Code Address where Thread to execute is located at
;	NOTE: Memory must have been allocated using _ProcessMemoryAlloc() with $PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE access
; $bWow64Code = If True, and *this* process is running in 64-bit mode, and the process being injected into is running
;	in 32-bit mode, this will ensure the Stub created is 32-bit code.
;	NOTE the pointer MUST be 32-bit sized (or can be cut down to 32-bit)
;	 Since any address within a 32-bit Process's address space MUST be 32-bit and accessible to the application
;	 (existing in its address space), this should not be a problem.
;
