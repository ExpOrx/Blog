Here are the most common problems :

  ANSWER: You must disable your Antivirus to use a such tools, don't worry DarkComet RAT detection is a false positive, it is a safe exectuable
          But antivirus companies must detect these tools because it is to oftenly used by Hackers.

  ANSWER: This is the symptom of Windows Defender, you must disable it (google it), it is in Windows Control Center > SECURITY > Windows Defender.

  ANSWER: Be sure your port are successfully forwarded using http://canyouseeme.org/ ; until this website notify your ports are correctly
          Forwarded, DarkComet won't work.
          Also disable any kind of Firewalls even Microsoft embedded one.

Feel free to use DarkComet RAT under a virtual environment as you need to disable all security in your machine, then it is more safe.
Notice you must setup your VM in bridge or physical interface instead of NAT in network settings.
